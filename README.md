# Ethical Hacking MindMap

This MindMap is not supposed to be all-inclusive. This is due to the MindMeister website becoming painfully slow after so many things to organize, to the point where I was having to wait 10s before adding any vector, writing anything or making any sort of change.

Therefore, I will be making another MindMap focusing only on the Practical side of Ethical Hacking, including: How to approach any Opened Ports, knowledge I acquired from CTFs, etc.

That being said, thank you so much for checking out my MindMap and I hope it can be useful to anyone getting into CyberSecurity!

Here's the link to the mindmap:
